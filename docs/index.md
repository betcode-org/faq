Frequently Asked Questions for the betcode open-source betting software and community.

---

The growing and vibrant betcode ecosystem offers tools and community support for developers and bettors who want to automate their betting strategies. Our [github repositories](https://github.com/betcode-org) offer open-source tools for consuming the APIs at the Betfair and BetConnect betting exchanges, and the Flumine trading framework that greatly simplifies the running of betting strategies.

Support for using these tools and strategy development in general is available from experienced (and profitable) sports bettors on our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/betcode-org/shared_invite/zt-25yz6dt1y-LHya5VzHLOzN3RZEQrSnrA).

Here you will find our FAQ that brings together many of the questions asked most frequently on that channel.
