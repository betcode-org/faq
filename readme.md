# betcode FAQ

This is FAQ draws from and supplements the discussions that take place in the Betcode Slack channel.

It is designed to be used with the Material for MkDocs documentation site generation tool, which Python users can install locally with ```pip install mkdocs-material```. Once installed, browse to folder where this repository has been closed and initiate an mkdocs server ```python -m mkdocs serve```. It will provide a localhost port number where the site may be viewed in a browser.

Use of a site generation tool saves an enormous amount of time, but inevitably at the cost of some restrictions. According all Q&A pairs must start with ```??? question``` followed by the question itself wrapped in double quotes. Answers must be indented and start on the next line, though multi paragraph answers are then possible and will end when the indenting ends - very pythonic.
